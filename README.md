# R Bootcamp

This project was created as part of the R Bootcamp module at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.


### Data Sources

Data for the project is sourced from [Citibike New York City](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) and [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (weather)](https://www.noaa.gov/).


### Data Limitation

A sample of 4000 observations representing four different months of the year 2019 was taken for the analysis. Another limitation is that the weather data used does not include measurements per hour, but per day. For this reason, it can be assumed that there are limitations in the accuracy of the calculated correlations.
